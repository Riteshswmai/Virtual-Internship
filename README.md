🚀 Excited to share my latest project at Atliq Technologies during my internship! I had the incredible opportunity to dive deep into the impact of the 5G launch at Wavecon Telecom.

🎯 Problem Statement: I analyzed a Power BI dashboard to uncover the effects of 5G on revenue and key performance indicators (KPIs). Check out my presentation video attached below for more details!
